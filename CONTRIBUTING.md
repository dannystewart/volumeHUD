# Contributing to volumeHUD

Before you contribute, please note that volumeHUD is designed with a specific and simple goal: cleanly replicating the classic pre-Tahoe macOS volume HUD.

Bug reports are always welcome! Please just check existing issues first, and include clear steps to reproduce if opening a new one.

I'm open to feature suggestions, but please understand that this project tries to remain minimal and prioritizes maintaining the classic macOS look and feel. Features that modernize the UI or significantly change core functionality are unlikely to be accepted.

## Pull Requests

**Please open an issue to discuss before submitting large PRs.**

Small bug fixes and improvements are welcome! Large refactors, UI redesigns, or architectural changes need discussion first.

### What I'm Looking For:

- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Features that align with the classic aesthetic
- Addressing gaps like keyboard backlight or hiding the system UI

### What I'm NOT Looking For:

- UI redesigns, especially toward different or more modern aesthetics
- Large code refactors without prior discussion
- Features that significantly alter core behavior

Thank you for your interest in the app and in contributing!
