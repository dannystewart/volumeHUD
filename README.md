# volumeHUD

A simple macOS app that brings back the classic volume and brightness HUDs.

## Why This Exists

With macOS Tahoe, Apple revamped Control Center and replaced the classic volume and brightness indicators of 25 years with tiny popovers in the corner of the screen, even smaller than notifications. They're barely visible, especially against light backgrounds, and they disappear before I remember where to look. Even after months on the Tahoe beta, I still haven't gotten used to it. It's bad UI.

So I did what any sane person would do: I picked up Xcode and wrote my first ever Mac app to bring back the classic macOS HUDs we all know and love (except Apple, apparently). They do what a good system indicator should do: they show you the value when you change them and then they go away. And get thisâ€”you can actually *see them*. A groundbreaking feature in 2025.

## What It Looks Like

Version 2.0 now includes a brightness HUD that looks and works the same.

## How to Use It

### Installation

You can get it from the repo, but I strongly recommend installing via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install dannystewart/apps/volumehud
```

### Interface

Launching the app a second time after it's already running will show a simple About box with a button to quit. It will also let you know if there's an update available.

To run on startup, you can add it to **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items & Extensions** > **Open at Login**.

### Permissions

The app will ask for two permissions, both of which are **completely optional:**

- **Accessibility:** The app works by detecting changes to volume and brightness. This means the HUD won't appear when you try to go below 0% or above 100% because the levels don't change. Input monitoring works around this by watching for key presses. That's the only thing you'll lose if you leave it off.
- **Notifications:** Notifications are used only to tell you that the app has started. It only happens when the app is launched manually, not if it's set to run on startup.
